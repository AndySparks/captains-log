# The Lake—Edition No. 1

Somewhere along the way I came up with this metaphor that life is like a well. I can't be the first person to say something like that, but I'm comfortable calling this idea mine. Over the years I've developed it and I think about it almost every day. One key characteristic to wells is that they're deep. But most people only ever see the surface. Sure, they drink from the well, but who knows how deep it goes? What's down there?

The more I thought about the well, the more I began calling it a lake. Life is a lake, or a well slash lake. All the combined vastness, richness, and depth of life is in this lake. Tons of people have walked by the lake, glanced at it, and said, "Isn't that a beautiful lake?" Life is beautiful. But what's below the surface? How deep does the lake go? What's at the bottom? 

Fresh off of a month of drinking to forget about how broken up with I was, I started 2018 committed to one grand challenge: get to a point of physical, mental, and emotional health. What's the difference between mental and emotional health? Hell if I know, but I committed to that goal. 

The biggest obstacle to my health this year was loneliness. Early in the year, I saw Brad Feld had read a collection of Kurt Vonnegut's graduation speeches. I didn't know much about Kurt Vonnegut beyond having listened to Player Piano  (thanks to Zach Boerger) in the car when I packed up my life and moved to San Francisco. The collection is called If This Isn't Nice, What is? It's one of the most important books I read this year. 

In one speech, Kurt says, "We are so lonely because we don't have enough friends and relatives. Human beings are supposed to live in stable, like-minded, extended families of fifty people or more. Your class spokesperson mourned the collapse of marriage in this country. Marriage is collapsing because our families are too small. A man cannot be a whole society to a woman, and a woman cannot be a whole society to a man."

I fell in love with those words.

Tim Urban's piece on [the ten types of odd friendships you're probably part of](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/10-types-odd-friendships-youre-probably-part.html) turned me onto the idea that sociologists consider three conditions to be necessary for close friendships to develop (1) proximity, (2) repeated, unplanned interactions, and (3) a setting that encourages people to let their guard down and confide in each other. Once you have the friendship, you can usually keep it with enough maintenance. But I think people need a few friends who meet all three of those criteria on a regular basis in order to not go absolutely bonkers. 

Short on friends who could hit all three criteria in the beginning of 2018, it took me until May before I found a few of my people. Sometimes I call these people Good People™. Lately, I've been calling them Bottom Dwellers Who Don't Take Themselves Too Goddamned Seriously. They're people who love to explore the bottom of the lake. Whether they're poets, software engineers, marketers doesn't matter. What matters is their earnest and self-motivated curiosity to learn more about something and squeeze the juice out of life before someone takes it away from them. 

In my exploration of the life lake, I've found a lot, but I imagine it's on the scale of an electron to the universe. I love all of you because you're Bottom Dwellers Who Don't Take Themselves Too Seriously. In my exploration of the life lake, I've found you, and you all make my life a lot less lonely. And for that, I'm deeply grateful. 

So that's why I decided to call these letters The Lake. 

Have a great Thursday tomorrow, y'all.
