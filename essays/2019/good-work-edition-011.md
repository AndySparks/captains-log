### ‚ÄúWrite this down.‚Äù

> ‚Äú‚Ä¶the secret of hunch cultivation is simple:
write everything down.‚Äù
‚ÄîSteven Johnson[^1]

In
[*Where Good Ideas Come From*](https://www.amazon.com/Where-Good-Ideas-Come-Innovation/dp/1594485380),
Steven Johnson writes about what he calls ‚Äúthe slow hunch.‚Äù
Charles Darwin didn‚Äôt wake up one day with the entire theory of natural selection worked
out, for instance.
It took him *months* to work out what his findings in the Galapagos meant, but first he
had to write them down.

The American sociologist [C. Wright Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Wright_Mills)
wrote an appendix to his 1959 book on society and the self,
[*The Sociological Imagination*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sociological_Imagination),
entitled ‚ÄúOn Intellectual Craftsmanship‚Äù (scanned portion available
[here](https://archivingthecity.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/mills_on_intellctual_craftmanship.pdf)).
So perfectly does Mills describes the value of keeping a ‚Äúfile‚Äù of one‚Äôs thoughts, ideas,
and other intellectual ephemera, that I feel the only justice I can give it is to tell you
to just read the damned thing and share two of my favorite highlights:

- ‚ÄúYou will have often noticed how carefully accomplished thinkers treat their own minds,
  how closely they observe their development and organize their experience.
  The reason they treasure their smallest experiences is that, in the course of a lifetime,
  modern man has so very little personal experience and yet experience is so important as a
  source of original intellectual work.
  To be able to trust yet to be skeptical of your own experience, I have come to believe, is
  one mark of the mature workman.‚Äù
  (p. 196, 197)
- ‚Äú‚Ä¶after a few years of independent work, rather than read entire books, you will very
  often read parts of many books from the point of view of some particular theme or topic in
  which you are interested and concerning which you have plans in your file.
  Therefore, you will take notes which do not fairly represent the books you read.
  You are using this particular idea, this particular fact, for the realization of your own
  projects.‚Äù (p. 199)

Whether your work requires you to learn how to lead a team, invent a new product, or write
something that moves people, many of your best ideas are likely to come to you over time.
Thomas Jefferson kept ivory tablets and charcoal on his belt for taking notes during the
day that he would transfer in the evenings to his
[commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book). Emily Dickinson scrawled
lines and ideas on
[salvaged scraps of paper](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/12/05/emily-dickinsons-singular-scrap-poetry).
Whether you‚Äôre a Moleskine person, or you talk into a digital recorder, or you embrace one
of the many great [note-taking apps](https://zapier.com/blog/best-note-taking-apps/) out
there, we now have more tools at our disposal than ever before for keeping our own
file‚Äîand keeping track of the thoughts and events whose value is yet to be known.

My friend [Zack](https://twitter.com/ZackShapiro) always says, ‚Äúthe best things in life
almost don‚Äôt happen,‚Äù and our Senior Editor [Rachel](https://twitter.com/DidYouWriteThat)
says, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt predict which small thing is going to change the course of your life.‚Äù
So when a thought comes to you while you walk to lunch, when you discover a quote that
wholly captures the way you see things, when something makes you tilt your head up and to
the left and say, ‚ÄúHuh,‚Äù **write it down**.

### This Week

#### KEEPING A FILE

- I‚Äôm a huge fan and user of
  [The PARA Method](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/the-p-a-r-a-method-a-universal-system-for-organizing-digital-information-75a9da8bfb37/)
  by [Tiago Forte](https://twitter.com/fortelabs). It‚Äôs a helpful answer to, ‚ÄúHow do I keep
  all my stuff organized when some of it is in Dropbox, a to-do list, a note-taking tool,
  Google Drive, my desktop, and a million other places?‚Äù
  Building on the
  [Getting Things Done (GTD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) methodology by
  [David Allen](https://twitter.com/gtdguy), PARA not only helps keep you organized across
  systems, you‚Äôll find using PARA makes it easier to find what you‚Äôre looking for.
- Speaking of all those different places you have things, ‚Äú[The Rad Guide to Productivity and Focus](https://www.dropbox.com/s/88ypezqyeq3mi3u/The%20Rad%20Guide%20to%20Productivity%20and%20Focus.pdf?dl=0),‚Äù
  by [Khe Hy](https://twitter.com/khemaridh) recommends a number of different tools to help you
  stay organized, including cool tips on how to get your Kindle highlights into other apps.
  I use [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) as my
  [Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management)
  system, [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) for task management, Dropbox and Google Drive for
  files of different types, and [Notion](http://notion.so/) at work.
- The vast majority of my file, commonplace, or whatever you want to call it, is private.
  In 2017, though, I began publishing some pieces publicly on GitHub in my [Captain‚Äôs Log](https://github.com/AndySparks/captains-log).
  I keep
  [reading lists](https://github.com/AndySparks/captains-log/tree/master/resources/reading-lists)
  and [annual collections](https://github.com/AndySparks/captains-log/tree/master/commonplace)
  of all the great things I found for others to browse there.
- Finally, ‚Äú[Gradually, then suddenly](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/gradually-then-suddenly),‚Äù
  by [Tim O‚ÄôReilly](https://twitter.com/timoreilly) is a piece we‚Äôve shared before, but it‚Äôs
  particularly relevant to keeping a file.
  You gradually collect quotes, write journal entries, save blog posts, record thoughts, and
  then suddenly one day you‚Äôll have a realization.
  So be patient, and keep writing things down.

That‚Äôs Good Work for this week.
Looking forward to what‚Äôs next.
