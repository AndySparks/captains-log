> “Reading is the work of the alert mind, is demanding, and under ideal conditions
produces finally a sort of ecstasy.”
—E.B. White[^1]

When I was nineteen, a friend and I started brewing beer.
I headed to Barnes & Noble and asked the gentleman at the counter if there were any books
about brewing beer.
Without a worry over being complicit in an underage brewing ring (😬), he ultimately
helped me find
[*Brewing Up a Business*](https://www.amazon.com/Brewing-Up-Business-Adventures-Founder/dp/0470942312)
by Dogfish Head Brewing Company founder Sam Calagione.
So began my career as an entrepreneur.
Since then I’ve bought books on how to write, sell, market a product, manage people, lead
a team, understand design, build a product, and more.

Sometimes I sit around wondering what the world would be like if macaroni came in even
more shapes (what’s your favorite?). Sometimes I wonder what the world would be like if we
taught young students the methods and joys of lifelong learning.
If a class existed called “Your Responsibility to Educate Yourself,” I’d be racing to
write the curriculum for what would doubtless be the very first lesson:
“How to Use Books to Learn How to Do the Thing You Want to Learn How to Do for the Very
Low Price of $9.99.”

Only 57% of U.S. adults in 2016 said they are “likely to read for work or school”[^2] and in
2018, 24% haven’t read a book “in whole or in part” in the last year.[^3]
Degree or no degree, the chances are you’re stuck on something in your career.
Whether you’re yearning to move from customer support to product management, you wanna
learn how to code, or you’re distraught over your failure to scratch your itch to write,
I’d be willing to bet a fair amount of cheddar that there’s a book out there that would
take you several steps toward getting that thing you want.
Someone has struggled with the same shit before.

I’ve had $10 books that have changed my life more materially than an entire four years of
college was able to do.
Think of spending money on books not as a cost, but as an investment.
If you’re cost- or environmentally conscious (or hell, you just like books),
[find a library](https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/california/articles/the-best-libraries-in-san-francisco/)
(or a
[library app](https://www.onlinecollege.org/2012/03/06/top-25-library-apps-for-the-ipad/)). As
for time, you don’t have to have two free hours every day to make this work.
I read over breakfast or lunch at least three times a week (it’s on my schedule!). That
adds up to over 100 hours of reading time a year.
Compare that to the time you’d waste if you had to invent the wheel every time you wanted
to drive.

### This Week

#### Non-Fiction to Unstick Yourself

In preparation for this post, I asked Twitter for suggestions for must-read non-fiction.
Check out the responses [here](https://twitter.com/SparksZilla/status/1136774075580178432),
and be sure to check out “[The Books of Capital Camp](https://twitter.com/aBergsEyeView/status/1136388301664018432)”
mentioned in the responses (hat tip to Erik Berg for the tweetstorm).
Below, I’ve added a few I didn’t see anyone call out that I think are worth reading:

- [*The Art of Possibility*](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Possibility-Transforming-Professional-Personal/dp/0142001104/),
  by [Rosamund Stone Zander](http://rosamundzander.com/about-roz.php) and
  [Benjamin Zander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Zander). I came across this book
  years ago listening to
  [🎧Tim Ferriss interview Seth Godin](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/tim-ferriss-show/the-tim-ferriss-show/e/46641573).
  Godin strongly recommended listening to the
  [🎧audiobook version](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Possibility-Transforming-Professional-Personal/dp/B004HY9254),
  and I couldn’t agree more;
  the two authors are a husband and wife duo and co-narrate the book.
- Reading
  [*Deep Work*](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692/), by
  [Cal Newport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Newport) was one of the best decisions I’ve
  made. My productivity has to have almost doubled.
  You can even get away with only reading the first half.
- I don’t agree with everything in
  [*The Courage to Be Disliked*](https://www.amazon.com/Courage-Be-Disliked-Phenomenon-Happiness/dp/1501197274),
  by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga, but it gave me the words to understand how crucial it
  is for each of us to feel useful and made me reflect on my relationships with others.

That’s Good Work for this week.
Looking forward to what’s next.
