**2019 was this newsletter’s inaugural year!**

This year, we covered everything from financial literacy to procrastination to why reading
fiction can make you a better leader.
Each topic came with links to some of the best readings and resources we could find—and a
themed song (we hope you were listening along!). You read our personal revelations, our
serious business learnings, and our moments of pure silliness.
In the first week of 2020, everyone at Holloway took a good look back at Good Work, so we
could share the editions we loved most.

### Our 10 favorite Good Works from 2019

author Ozzie Osman.
We highly recommend taking a few extra minutes for this intelligent and heartfelt work!
