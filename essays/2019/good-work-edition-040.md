> ‚ÄúRockefeller loved Flagler‚Äôs dictum that a friendship founded on business was superior
to a business founded on friendship, and for several decades they worked together in an
almost seamless fashion.‚Äù
‚ÄîRon Chernow, Titan[^1]

Work, as we often think about it, is a place to get things done, to put food on the table,
to make that bread.
But for me, work has also been the place I‚Äôve met my closest friends.

Kurt Vonnegut wrote that when couples tend to fight, ‚Äúwhat they‚Äôre really saying is,
‚Äòyou‚Äôre not enough people.‚Äô‚Äù We are biologically suited to thrive in groups of ~150, where
everyone has a purpose and that purpose is always related to supporting the health of the
group. But we don‚Äôt live in groups of 150. We‚Äôre connected to billions of people around
the world, but we‚Äôre often alone.

As we go about our lives, occasionally we meet people who we‚Äôd really like to pair up
with, either as friends, romantic partners, bandmates, business partners, drinking
buddies, D&D teammates, or whatever.
I call these people fellow travelers;
my friend Carrie calls them ‚Äúkeepers.‚Äù

Churches, schools, and book clubs allow us to scale down the global village to include
people with similar goals, priorities, and values.
But we don‚Äôt all attend churches, play music, go to school, or have the time for a weekly
book club. Just about all of us go to work.
Rarely, when considering a new job opportunity, do we consider the likelihood of whether
someone on the team will be a keeper.
However important our work is and feels, when the work is done, it‚Äôs the friendships‚Äîthe
keepers‚Äîwe‚Äôll value above all else.
