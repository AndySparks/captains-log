> ‚ÄúA book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.‚Äù
‚ÄîCarl Sagan[^1]

It‚Äôs hard to make the case that studying someone who mastered a craft by reading their
biography would be a waste of time.
Likewise, reading popular non-fiction that aims to explain how some part of the world
works can hardly be spun as a *waste* of time.
But it‚Äôs a hell of a lot less clear how *fiction* fits into the picture of self-directed
professional growth.
After all, how could something *made up* be related to a career?
But isn‚Äôt that exactly what a career is‚Äîsomething made up?

Careers and companies are made up of and made up *by* people every day‚Äîboth start as ideas
in someone‚Äôs head, and through sweat and collaboration and a lot of luck the idea just
might manifest.
Fiction can be like a [magic school bus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v53mhRXXT2g) we can
hop on to explore endless possible worlds, which isn‚Äôt so different from how a founder
thinks about their company‚Äôs mission.
The folks behind fiction open up windows to the lives and minds of those quite unlike us,
who are somehow also us.
By showing us what we could be, they reveal what we are.

Fiction can motivate us and steady us, inspire us and humble us.
Every time I find myself frustrated with someone in a professional context, I remember a
line from John Steinbeck‚Äôs
[*East of Eden*](https://www.amazon.com/East-Eden-Penguin-Orange-Collection/dp/0143129481): ‚ÄúI
am certain that underneath their topmost layers of frailty men want to be good and want to
be loved. Indeed, most of their vices are attempted short cuts to love.‚Äù
And every time I find myself in a fit of excitement over a new idea, I think of Frank
Herbert‚Äôs words in [*Dune*](https://www.amazon.com/Dune-Frank-Herbert/dp/0441172717): ‚ÄúHope
clouds observation.‚Äù

If you want to better understand your customers, coworkers, and investors, turn to fiction
to help you gain some empathy and perspective and see into the minds of others.
And don‚Äôt forget that the best fiction is created to help you understand something about
yourself that you didn‚Äôt before;
any founder or investor will tell you that the most important quality of a good leader is
self-awareness.Consider fiction a master course in psychology, and a mirror to who we
really are. You won‚Äôt get lost here.
It‚Äôs a place you go to be found.

### This Week

#### Fiction

- I encourage anyone interested in how automation, augmented reality, artificial
  intelligence, and other hot potato topics loved by pundits to read books like
  [*Player Piano*](https://www.amazon.com/Player-Piano-Novel-Kurt-Vonnegut/dp/0385333781) by Kurt
  Vonnegut, [*Daemon*](https://www.amazon.com/DAEMON-Daemon-Daniel-Suarez/dp/0451228731), by
  Daniel Suarez,
  [*Accelerando*](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerando-Singularity-Charles-Stross/dp/0441014151/),
  by Charles Stross, and
  [*The Quantum Thief*](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Thief-Jean-Flambeur/dp/0765329492/), by
  Hannu Rajaniemi.
  Doing so is like putting on scuba gear and exploring the depths of possibility in an ocean
  of ideas, whereas listening to talking heads parrot talking points is more akin to
  strapping yourself with floaties and going for a swim in the kiddie pool of ideas.
- Check out the ‚Äúawesome lists‚Äù for
  [science fiction](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-scifi) and
  [fantasy](https://github.com/RichardLitt/awesome-fantasy). Each list is collaborative (you can
  open a pull request and add to it) and includes hundreds of titles with short (no
  spoilers) reviews and ratings.
  I recommend browsing the descriptions until you find something that piques your interest.
- ‚Äú[The Symbolism Survey](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2011/12/05/document-the-symbolism-survey/)‚Äù
  is one of my favorite fiction-related articles.
  I always *hated* how English teachers had a habit of turning the magic of a book into a
  torturous analysis.
  The Symbolism Survey shows responses from famous authors who responded to a 1963 high
  school student‚Äôs letters asking whether authors purposefully put symbolism in their
  writing.
- If you‚Äôre not convinced about the value of reading fiction yet, don‚Äôt take my word for it.
  Harvard Business School‚Äôs ‚Äú[Read Fiction and Be a Better Leader](https://hbr.org/ideacast/2013/06/read-fiction-and-be-a-better-l.html),‚Äù
  and ‚Äú[Why Business Leaders Need to Read More Science Fiction](https://hbr.org/2017/07/why-business-leaders-need-to-read-more-science-fiction)‚Äù
  are both short reads, and recommend specific works to get you started.

What are some of your favorite fiction books?

That‚Äôs Good Work for this week.
Looking forward to what‚Äôs next.
