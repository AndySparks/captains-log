> ‚ÄúI feel and think much as you do, care about many of the things you care about,
although most people don‚Äôt care about them.
You are not alone.‚Äù
‚ÄîKurt Vonnegut[^timequakep.l0n7nk]

A few weeks back, a friend of mine asked me a question over text.
‚ÄúNow that you are where you are in your career, fairly established, how do you think about
building your network and furthering those relationships?
Or is it mostly a byproduct of what Holloway needs?‚Äù
What a lovely question to ask and what a delightful one to answer.

But it begins with some immediate bristling.
See, I could do without the word *network*. The way we might hear a
[Midtown Uniform](https://www.instagram.com/midtownuniform) say, ‚ÄúTotally, bro, I‚Äôma batcall
my network,‚Äù it‚Äôs a flippant way to describe real people with real lives and real goals
and real feelings as commodities we can go shopping for in some theoretical Target that
carries people and favors instead of orange juice and
[premium mediocre](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/)
blankets.

Over the years, I‚Äôve developed this idea of what I call *fellow travelers*, not a network,
not relationships I‚Äôve built, not my ‚Äútribe.‚Äù
Sure, there‚Äôs all the people in various places on my
[Life Mountain](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/10-types-odd-friendships-youre-probably-part.html),
but I believe what people are really asking about when they ask about networks is how they
find more people to fall in love with.
We meet fellow travelers at dysfunctional work functions and places of play.
They‚Äôre the people who share our values.
The ones we feel at ease with.
The ones we call when we somehow have an open night and want to be real with someone who‚Äôs
real.

How do you find fellow travelers and keep them traveling with you?
When I was twenty-fiveish, I wrote out my values.
The first cut was decent.
I valued risk-taking, mastery, and curiosity.
Over the years, ‚ÄúPeople who don‚Äôt take themselves too goddamned seriously!‚Äù
has risen to be the quality I value most in friends or colleagues.
When you take yourself too seriously, you can‚Äôt take a joke, you can‚Äôt take feedback, your
ego drives you, and I just don‚Äôt want to spend my life ride seated next to folks who‚Äôve
wound themselves up so tight that they can‚Äôt appreciate the absolute and utter absurdity
of the experience of being alive.
People I met who didn‚Äôt take themselves too seriously made my traveling feel less alone.

Listing out what you value most in yourself and want to see shared by others, or qualities
you‚Äôre struggling to attain or ways of being you simply appreciate can be helpful when
looking for fellow travelers.
Here are a few more of mine:

- Believe in giving assholes a run for their money
- Are interested in leaving the planet better than we found it
- Love learning, reading, absorbing knowledge
- Are willing to abandon certitude in the face of new evidence
- Demonstrate character and respect
- Are willing to take risks

Building your filter helps you recognize these people when you meet them.
But finding them is hard enough, so when you do, don‚Äôt miss the opportunity to reach out.
Follow them on Twitter?
Interact! See someone‚Äôs work on YouTube you admire?
Find their email and tell them (this is how I met *the*
[Michael Marantz](http://michaelmarantz.com/)). Go to conferences.
Make it your goal to meet *one* person at the entire conference whom you think you could
be friends with for more than ten years.
I‚Äôve been doing this for almost a decade.
It‚Äôs been the single most valuable tool I‚Äôve sussed for finding fellow travelers.

Finally, this is a newsletter about work, *Good Work*. Find your fellow travelers, but
don‚Äôt stop at falling in love with them.
Start *making things* with them.
Make a short film.
Throw a monthly dinner.
Buy a canvas, some paint, some firecrackers, and a six pack and see where Sunday takes
you. Ask your fellow travelers for help.
Show them your writing.
Share your goals about doing that thing you‚Äôd do if only you *had the time*. Do business
with these people.
And when they share *their* goals, do your best to make them *your* goals.
Hell, that‚Äôs what they‚Äôd do for you, right?

### This Week

#### FELLOW TRAVELERS

- In ‚Äú[A Short History of 52 Cups](http://www.52cups.com/post/95162640035/a-short-history-of-52-cups),‚Äù
  [Megan Gebhart](http://www.megangebhart.com/) shares the highlights of her super rad idea to
  meet a different person for coffee every week for 52 weeks.
  At the end of each coffee, Gebhart would ask for recommendations for her next cups.
  Spoiler: her last cup of coffee was with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.
  For anyone nervous about finding fellow travelers, I love the idea of starting with 52
  cups like Gebhart did.
- [*Give and Take: Why Helping Others Drives Our Success*](https://www.amazon.com/Give-Take-Helping-Others-Success/dp/0143124986),
  by [Adam Grant](https://twitter.com/AdamMGrant) is one of my all-time favorite books.
  He describes three reciprocity styles:
  givers, matchers, and takers.
  I look for givers.
  If you think you get the gist of this book, please still read it.
- This week is a week of all-time favorites.
  Another favorite of mine is ‚Äú[Most People Won‚Äôt](http://bryce.vc/post/64889707700/most-people-wont),‚Äù
  by [Bryce Roberts](https://twitter.com/bryce). Meeting fellow travelers often means taking a
  risk. Reach out.
  Say hi. Tell someone you love their tattoos, their funky flowery shirt.
  Ask that person you met at a party to get together for a coffee or a beer and tell them
  you like hanging out.
  I know this sounds trivial but man *this is life*.
- Patrick Collison, CEO of Stripe, is one of a few folks this year who have
  [pointed out](https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1052380633253572608) the value of telling
  someone when you appreciate their work.
  The first person I remember telling I loved their work was Michael Marantz ([here‚Äôs the email](https://www.dropbox.com/s/eu753ohnf20994t/Screenshot%202019-03-29%2011.39.41.png?dl=0)).
  Since then, we‚Äôve developed a hell of a friendship and he‚Äôs one of my favorite people.
  We even made [a thing](https://vimeo.com/44658040) together.
  So tell people when you love their work.
  The worst thing that can happen is they don‚Äôt respond.
  Hat tip to [Alex DeBrie](https://twitter.com/alexbdebrie/status/1111698618774364160) for
  helping me find Patrick‚Äôs tweet.

#### GOOD WORK

On that note, we‚Äôd like to give a few shout outs to Good Work we‚Äôve recently come to
admire.

- [*The Shape of Design*](https://shapeofdesignbook.com/) by
  [Frank Chimero](https://twitter.com/frank_chimero) is an absolutely stunning digital
  presentation of a book.
  Not only is the experience impressive and beautiful, the content of the book is pretty
  darn good too.
  Thanks for being awesome, Frank.
- [*The Monocle Guide to Good Business*](https://monocle.com/shop/product/540412/the-monocle-guide-to-good-business/)
  is a $60 book.
  It‚Äôs a lot of cheddar for a book, and it‚Äôs probably not for everyone.
  But it is beautiful, we appreciate the long list of folks at
  [Monocle](https://twitter.com/MonocleMag) who worked on this, and I‚Äôve loved flipping through
  it over the last two weeks.
  Hat tip to [Brandon Myint](https://twitter.com/brandonmyint) for telling me about it.
- [Onym](https://onym.co/) is a strange bird of a website.
  At Holloway, we pride ourselves on building resources that are 10x more comprehensive and
  helpful than anything else on a subject, so we kind of know ‚Äúcomprehensive‚Äù when we see
  it. Onym, ‚ÄúTools and resources for naming things,‚Äù is comprehensive, very comprehensive.
  Thanks to [Greg Leppert](https://twitter.com/leppert) and
  [Willem Van Lancker](https://twitter.com/vanlancker) for making it and hat tip to
  [Marc Hemon](https://twitter.com/hemeon) for texting me about it this week.
- Other people who I‚Äôve come to love following on Twitter lately:
  [Brianne Kimmel](https://twitter.com/briannekimmel), [Anna G√°t](https://twitter.com/TheAnnaGat),
  [Tyler Willis](https://twitter.com/tylerwillis), & [Dan Shipper](https://twitter.com/danshipper).

That‚Äôs Good Work for this week.
Looking forward to what‚Äôs next.

Andy and the Holloway Team
