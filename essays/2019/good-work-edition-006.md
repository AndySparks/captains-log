In editions [four](https://www.holloway.com/s/good-work-edition-004) and
[five](https://www.holloway.com/s/good-work-edition-005) of Good Work, I wrote about the
importance of asking ourselves what we’re optimizing for.
It’s painfully easy to stumble around in life without pausing to reflect on whether we’re
pointed in the right direction, and there’s endless pressure to point ourselves off The
Cliffs of Workaholism and The Pits of “Oh My God This is *Not* Where I Thought I’d Be By
Now.” Tools for figuring out what we’re optimizing for and whether that’s what we want are
about as abundant as tools for physical fitness, but this week I’d like to explore one
close to my heart:
journaling.

Journaling is my favorite tool for self-discovery.
Journaling has helped me realize I need to get out of a toxic relationship and recognize
the negative impact of poor life decisions like drinking too much or failing to exercise.
Journaling is the reason why I’ve been able to repair relationship mistakes, both at work
and away from the office.
It’s what led me to leave my last company, Mattermark, and start Holloway.

To a lot of folks, journaling *sounds* great, but they give up quickly because well, it’s
a lot of work.
Instead of thinking of journaling as something you’ll do a few times and see the benefit,
think of journaling like *exercise*. You’re going to have to do this for a while before
you start seeing gains, and you’re going to have to do it regularly.
You’re going to feel uncomfortable, and you’re going to feel like everyone else has it
figured out. Remember, you’re new to this, and there are tools out there for making
journaling easier ([Day One](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/day-one-journal/id1044867788?),
[750 Words](https://750words.com/), [200 words a day](https://200wordsaday.com/), and
[Jour](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jour-guided-journaling/id1439590239) are a few).

Beyond these tools, I recommend everyone buy Julia Cameron’s
*[The Artist’s Way](https://www.amazon.com/Artists-Way-25th-Anniversary/dp/0143129252)*. You can
take my word for it, or you can take the word of
*[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/style/julia-cameron-the-artists-way.html)*:
“Julia Cameron invented the way people renovate the creative soul.”
Cameron prescribes several exercises in her book, but one of them is “morning pages,”
which involves writing three pages, stream of consciousness, every single morning.
Stream of consciousness means you don’t think about whether the writing is any good, you
just open up your brain and put it on paper.
I’ve done morning pages off and on for ten years now, and the first sentence is almost
always silly. Here are a few real examples from my journal:

> “I don’t need to be writing for anyone else.
How are you doing, man?
I know you’re struggling.
You’re happy, but you’re struggling and that’s hard to reconcile.
It’s been good to get back to work in San Francisco vs.
running all over New York City and struggling to find internet.

> “Calling this morning perfect is too much of an undeserved platitude.
It’s downright cruel, in fact.
My dear friend, Gary, is my hangover.
On time and deserved, Gary reminded me the finer nuance of how Saturday mornings are
indeed for sleeping in, but they are most certainly not for sleeping through.”

> “I’ve got my goddam writing hat on tonight.
There’s this hilarious aside to that statement and no one else is in on the joke but me,
so I’ll do my best to cut you in on it.”

Morning pages don’t necessarily have to be done in the morning, but you’ll find they’re
great for cleaning out your mental pipes so you can get to the office with a clear head.
After you write Morning Pages for a month or two, you begin to notice patterns in your
writing. You write about the same people, the same insecurities, the same dreams.
I found the exercise immensely more valuable when I restarted Morning Pages when I moved
to Silicon Valley at twenty-two.

The more I wrote, I began to pick up tricks.
By twenty-six, I began Morning Pages with the prompt, “What are you avoiding writing
about?” Another trick:
“What’s everything making you anxious right now?”
Once you see your thoughts on a screen or on paper, something strange happens.
Your thoughts are no longer swimming with each other in your head, they’re somewhere else,
somewhere for you to *deal with them*.

I left my last company, Mattermark, after continuously asking myself, “Why does something
feel *off* about work?”
It took me months of journaling to get to the bottom of this, but get to the bottom of it
I did. I asked myself, “What do I want?”
And then I wrote down *everything* I wanted.
With it there on the screen, I could see that I wasn’t on the path to getting what I
wanted. So I took a new path, one that journaling helped me find.

  [Hayley Phelan](https://twitter.com/HayleyHPhelan) of *The New York Times* shares a deeper
  take on Cameron’s methodology and cites a few studies that suggest journaling can lead to
  a stronger immune system and possibly increase how fast your wounds heal (not kidding).

  leadership is rooted in several capabilities:
  seeing before others see, understanding before others understand, and acting before others
  act…most of us live such fast-paced, frenzied lives that we fail to leave time to actually
  listen to ourselves.”
- \[15m] [Benjamin Hardy's](https://twitter.com/BenjaminPHardy) “[How To Write In Your Journal To Improve Yourself and Achieve Your Goals](https://medium.com/@benjaminhardy/how-to-write-in-your-journal-to-improve-yourself-and-achieve-your-goals-7a8171aabad3)”

  [illustrates](https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T5325H6AD-FGQ5SJS85-b9cea80f3b/screenshot_2019-03-05_10.42.53_1024.png)
  how Twitter users can leverage their followers to come up with more ideas.
  This is one of my favorite use cases for Twitter, and in the first link in the next
  section, I’ll show you exactly how I go about it.
  Ironically, I could not find any of the three authors on Twitter.

#### REMOTE WORK

- On Friday, I was chatting with Holloway’s own [Hope Hackett](https://twitter.com/Hopeopolis)
  about the pros and cons of remote, or distributed teams.
  We threw a few ideas on a whiteboard, and then
  [I tweeted a photo](https://twitter.com/SparksZilla/status/1104100291043942400) of the
  whiteboard asking for more ideas.
  I’ve rolled all the responses up in
  [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1555EAwzB4vGxyT4hqkkfvLKUopMqWifUFE3uOxLR2Nw/edit#),
  which is open for all to add more ideas to.
- \[7 Tweets] [Amir Salihefendić](https://twitter.com/amix3k) of
  [Doist](https://twitter.com/Doist), the company behind [Todoist](https://twitter.com/todoist)
  (I’m a huge fan and user BTW),
  [tweeted](https://twitter.com/amix3k/status/1103740848519434240) about the importance of
  asynchronous communication with remote teams.
- 🔝 Rollup: I hate blog posts that don’t include bylines.
  It’s an insult to the hard work that went into the post.
  Still, this authorless rollup of podcasts related to remote work is pretty good.
  Check out “[The Best Remote Work Podcasts](https://www.workplaceless.com/blog/best-remote-work-podcasts).”

That’s Good Work for this week.
Looking forward to what’s next.
