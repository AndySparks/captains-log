> ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing intrinsic about the manual trades when it comes to generating this
particular source of meaning.
Any pursuit‚Äîbe it physical or cognitive‚Äîthat supports high levels of skill can also
generate a sense of sacredness.‚Äù
‚ÄîCal Newport, *Deep Work*[^1]

In my century-old house, the hinges on every door are covered in layers of paint.
For a hundred years, the people painting this house refused to find a screwdriver or to
tape around the hinges, dooming me to stare at this mess.
On Holloway‚Äôs Work-From-Home Wednesday this week, around 5 o‚Äôclock PM, some part of me
snapped. I had to go nuclear on those suckers, strip them down to the brass I knew lay
below the strata of practical beiges, ‚ÄúCareful Whisper‚Äù blues, and a hundred other bad
decisions and attempts to mask them.

On the way to the hardware store with plans to strip every hinge in the house, and sand a
quarter inch off the bottom of a door that kept catching on the carpet, my brain
confronted me.
‚ÄúIs there a better use of your evening?
How ‚Äòbout taking something off the top of your to-do list, brother?
Something urgent and important or, hell, leave urgent out of the equation and go with
something plain old important.‚Äù
As if sitting across the table from a colleague, I thought back to myself, ‚ÄúGreat point,
but [how about no?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lITBGjNEp08)‚Äù The rest of the night, as I
sanded and boiled off the latex and lord knows what they used to paint in the 1920‚Äôs
(yeah, I know, freaking lead), I kept asking myself, ‚ÄúWhat on Earth are you doing this
for?‚Äù

Some call this
[Yak Shaving](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/YakShavingDefinedIllGetThatDoneAsSoonAsIShaveThisYak.aspx),
portrayed with brilliance in *Malcolm in the Middle* with
[Hal fixing a light bulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0). See, my *actual work*,
you know, the stuff I spend fifty or sixty hours a week doing and getting paid for,
consists of jumping between product design, writing-to-think, writing-to-publish, internal
and external meetings, spreadsheets for finance, spreadsheets for marketing, and no
shortage of staring out the window while waiting for my thoughts to fall into place like
[Teewees and Orange Rickies](https://www.joe.co.uk/gaming/tetris-block-names-221127) onto the
cool blue infinite of my entire life.
Rarely does my work afford me the twin pleasures of starting something and finishing it in
a day, and *oh my god it‚Äôs a real thing I can touch, point to, or use, something done.*

In the end, I got down to brass.
As I cleaned the sawdust out of every cavity of my home, muscles aching from handling and
sanding the beast of the old door, I realized how important it is to me to have that
tactile achievement, every once in a while, to have something to point to and say, ‚ÄúI did
that.‚Äù I had only improved minute details I doubt others will ever notice.
Certainly, no one‚Äôs saying thank you.
But what is Good Work at any level, from building a company to raising a skyscraper, if
not work done with patience and dedication?
A conscientious commitment to steady, incremental progress, week after week, for years at
a time? If infinite regress is ‚Äúturtles all the way down,‚Äù maybe progress is just
polishing hinges.

### This Week

#### Polishing Hinges

- Last week, I tweeted ‚Äú[Who has taught you something that will stick with you forever? What was it?](https://twitter.com/SparksZilla/status/1178385532906176512?s=20)‚Äù
  The replies are a fun read.
- ‚Äú[Three Big Things: The Most Important Forces Shaping the World](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/three-big-things-the-most-important-forces-shaping-the-world/)‚Äù
  by Morgan Housel was an informative Saturday morning read this week.
- *[If This Isn‚Äôt Nice, What Is? (Much) Expanded Second Edition: The Graduation Speeches and Other Words to Live By](https://www.amazon.com/This-Isnt-Nice-Expanded-Second/dp/1609806972)*
  by Kurt Vonnegut is my favorite discovery of the last three years.
  I promise you won‚Äôt regret the time you invest in reading Vonnegut‚Äôs graduation speeches.
- To avoid yak shaving, give ‚Äú[Fierce Prioritization](https://feld.com/archives/2019/09/fierce-prioritization.html)‚Äù
  by Brad Feld a read.
  It‚Äôs quick but powerful.
- At some level, polishing hinges has to do with being comfortable slogging through the
  parts of Good Work that aren‚Äôt exciting to share with your significant other at the end of
  a day.
  *[The Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick)](https://www.amazon.com/Dip-Little-Book-Teaches-Stick/dp/1591841666)*,
  by Seth Godin, is a good resource for wrapping your head around the struggle of the slog.
- While I haven‚Äôt read it, others recommend
  *[The Messy Middle: Finding Your Way Through the Hardest and Most Crucial Part of Any Bold Venture](https://www.amazon.com/Messy-Middle-Finding-Through-Hardest/dp/0735218072)*,
  by Scott Belsky, to me all the time, and it‚Äôs made it onto my ‚Äúnext up of non-fiction‚Äù
  list. It seems like the sister book to *The Dip*.

That‚Äôs Good Work for this week.
Looking forward to what‚Äôs next.
