> ‚ÄúOne of the few appealing things about him was that he had figured out that his
personality was a problem and, in classic ‚Äòget it done‚Äô style, had hired a coach to make
him less of an asshole.
She could see that working in his face.‚Äù

[Tyler Lyman](https://twitter.com/tblyman), a new Good Work subscriber, wrote us on Monday
asking if we had plans any time soon to explore the relationship between startup founder
and executive coach.
I hadn‚Äôt decided what to write about for this week‚Äôs Good Work yet and thought tackling
the subject would be a breeze-my co-founder, Josh, and I happened to be headed in to see
our coach the next day.

Inspired, I dashed off my thoughts on how working with our amazing coach, Christina
Harbridge, has been one of the most valuable professional experiences in my life, when
Josh pointed out that most people-even those who can afford it-don‚Äôt ever get a therapist,
let alone a professional executive coach.

‚ÄúAre coaches like having a butler or a gardener-things certain rich people have but only
because they have a mansion or a big estate?‚Äù
he asked.

While not quite like having a butler or a gardener, Josh was of course right in pointing
out that access to executive coaching is a privilege.
In that moment, he also acted as a great coach to me, showing me a blindspot but not
making me feel ashamed of it.
The best coaches, whether they‚Äôre a paid executive coach, a parent, or just a friend who
listens earnestly over a few pints, perform the same function.
Put one way, ‚ÄúA coach is someone who can give correction without causing resentment.‚Äù[^enwikipedi.k5ew77]
They‚Äôre there to help you be successful, and to do this they tactfully help you become
aware of behavior that‚Äôs impeding your goals.

While coaches can be valuable regardless of your position in a company, they can be
immensely valuable to CEOs, as the nature of their role leaves them without a manager to
mentor them. If you‚Äôre calling the shots on whether you or someone on your team gets a
coach, think about it as an investment, not a one-time cost.

[Growth](https://fs.blog/2015/03/carol-dweck-mindset/) necessitates a trail of trials-you must
always be starting over, learning new things, and true mastery requires the wisdom of
knowing that nothing can ever be truly mastered.
In addition to acting as a mirror for you to see who you are and the path to becoming the
person you need to grow into, coaches can help soften and shorten the cycles of repeatedly
being bad at things.

### This Week

#### COACHES

- Aside from my coach, Christina, I‚Äôve had the privilege of spending time with
  [Jerry Collona](https://www.reboot.io/team/jerry-colonna/) and
  [Khalid Halim](https://twitter.com/khalidhalim) of Reboot.
  All three of them are absolutely delightful people.
  I also frequently refer to parts of executive coach Matt Mochary‚Äôs book, The Great CEO
  Within (available as a
  [free Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZJZbv4J6FZ8Dnb0JuMhJxTnwl-dwqx5xl0s65DE3wO8/edit#heading=h.pdmqf3646hgt)).
- [15m] Wired‚Äôs profile on Jerry Collona, ‚Äú[This Man Makes Founders Cry](https://www.wired.com/2017/02/this-man-makes-founders-cry/),‚Äù
  by [Jessi Hempel](https://twitter.com/jessiwrites), will give you a close look at the man who
  has worked with the likes of Etsy CEO Chad Dickerson and Gimlet Media co-founders Alex
  Blumberg and Matt Lieber.
- \[16m] ‚Äú[The Science of Speaking is the Art of Being Heard](https://firstround.com/review/the-science-of-speaking-is-the-art-of-being-heard/),‚Äù
  a piece about Khalid Halim of Reboot in *First Round Review*, unpacks several of Halim‚Äôs
  favorite frameworks and tools he uses when working with his clients.
  After re-reading this piece this week, I think I‚Äôm going to setup a reminder to frequently
  refer to it.

#### THINKING LONG-TERM

- [6m] A transcript of a short podcast with Naval Ravikant, ‚Äú[Play Long-term Games With Long-term People](https://startupboy.com/2019/03/19/long-term/),‚Äù
  is a great distillation of a principle I‚Äôve applied at conferences ever since I met
  [Danielle Morrill](https://twitter.com/DanielleMorrill) at SXSW in 2010: meet one person who I
  believe I could be friends with for more than ten years.
- üé• [27m] Eight years later, I met Michael Shearn at a conference using this method, and I
  had the privilege of spending several days with him last week in Austin.
  Michael runs an investment firm where he focuses on doing an immense amount of research on
  the CEO before investing.
  He‚Äôs a fascinating guy, and you should watch
  [this interview](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/12/21/michael-shearn-invest-in-leadership.aspx)
  with him (transcript also available on the page).
- [24m] On a similar thread, I‚Äôm constantly looking to learn from leaders who don‚Äôt fit the
  Silicon Valley mold.
  This [interview with Brunello Cucinelli](https://pi.co/brunello-cucinelli-2/) by
  [Om Malik](https://twitter.com/om) is full of ideas about running a business that you don‚Äôt
  hear in Northern California.
  Thanks to [Julian Targowski](https://twitter.com/julek) for pointing this one out.

That‚Äôs Good Work for this week.
Looking forward to what‚Äôs next.
