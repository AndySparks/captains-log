> "The city was then the great maw of American capitalism.
That is to say, it took resources and raw materials from everywhere and converted them
into money at an unprecedented rate."
‚ÄîChristopher Hitchens[^1]

Last week we teed up our plans to publish a series of short introductions on different
functions of a business in hopes of spurring greater cross-functional literacy.
My 10th grade social studies teacher taught us that political power is nothing more than a
function of trade.
Businesses are formalized groups of people who‚Äôve come together for the explicit purpose
of *conducting* trade, and finance‚Äîthe subject of this week‚Äôs Good Work‚Äîis the system
we‚Äôve come up for *keeping track of* trade.

Finance folks are fond of foreign-sounding formulae like Free Cash Flow (FCF), Discounted
Cash Flow (DCF), Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), Earnings Before Interest Taxes
Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), and Single Income Two Children and Oppressive
Mortgage (SITCOM‚Äîyes, that‚Äôs real).
Their primary tools are financial statements (balance sheets, income statements, and cash
flows), all saved in Microsoft Excel (no, *not* Google Sheets).
The whole world kind of runs on Microsoft Excel.

It‚Äôs tempting to think of finance as a ‚Äúnumbers thing‚Äù and leave it up to ‚Äúpeople on the
business side.‚Äù
But financial literacy‚Äîunderstanding how we trade things and move money around‚Äîwill help
anyone‚Äôs career.
If you‚Äôre a designer, engineer, writer, or painter, you‚Äôll eventually hit a brick wall in
your career if you fail to grasp the relationship between the cost, revenue, and profit of
whatever it is you‚Äôre creating.

We‚Äôve pulled together a short list of tools and resources you can use to teach yourself
the basics of finance.
On top of that, we recommend you walk on over to the finance side of the house tomorrow
and ask someone there out to lunch.
Over Chipotle, find out what they do on a typical day, what kinds of things they were
hired to worry about, how they got into the field, and how they think you could benefit
from learning more about what they do.

### This Week

#### Financial Literacy

- Investopedia is a terrific corner of the internet.
  They‚Äôve pulled together definitions of hundreds of financial terms in their
  [Financial Dictionary](https://www.investopedia.com/dictionary/). When you‚Äôre unclear as to
  what someone‚Äôs talking about in financial lingo, look it up there.
- Yes,
  ‚Äú[Understanding Financial Statements](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/valn2ed/ch3.pdf),‚Äù
  by NYU Professor of Finance [Aswath Damodaran](https://twitter.com/AswathDamodaran) is a 44
  page PDF. But it‚Äôs also a terrific primer you can download, mark up, re-read, and refer to
  anytime you feel you‚Äôd benefit from understanding how to read the things.
- If you want to go even deeper into accounting without taking a finance class, read
  [*Financial Intelligence, Revised Edition: A Manager‚Äôs Guide to Knowing What the Numbers Really Mean*](https://www.amazon.com/Financial-Intelligence-Revised-Managers-Knowing/dp/1422144119),
  by [Karen Berman](https://financialintelligencebook.com/the-authors/karen-berman/),
  [Joe Knight](https://financialintelligencebook.com/the-authors/joe-knight/), and
  [John Case](https://financialintelligencebook.com/the-authors/john-case/). I have a copy on my
  desk.
- When a company files for an initial public offering (IPO), they have to file a form called
  an S-1 that lays out the state of their finances for everyone to read.
  They‚Äôre wildly revealing documents, and fun to read if you‚Äôre beginning to geek out on
  finance. Check out
  ‚Äú[From Private To Public: How To Read An S-1](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/how-to-read-an-s1/),‚Äù
  by [Alex Wilhelm](https://twitter.com/alex).
- If you‚Äôre less psyched about the numbers and more interested in learning about finance
  through some good ol‚Äô narrative,
  [*The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success*](https://www.amazon.com/Outsiders-Unconventional-Radically-Rational-Blueprint/dp/1422162672),
  by William N. Thorndike is the book for you.
  By no means does it skip the technical details, and I think it should be required reading
  for anyone serious about business.
- Finally, I recommend signing up for Wharton‚Äôs
  [Introduction to Corporate Finance](https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-finance) on
  Coursera. It‚Äôs 100% free, and it will help you not only get the theory but it also has
  exercises to help you put it into practice.

That‚Äôs Good Work for this week.
Looking forward to what‚Äôs next.
