> “Without work, all life goes rotten, but when work is soulless, life stifles and dies.”
—Albert Camus[^schumacher.8m551g]

Last week, we wrote about the
[importance of looking within](https://www.holloway.com/s/good-work-edition-004) to answer the
question, “What are you optimizing for?”
In a delightful turn—and reason #2,573 why I love the internet—Medium featured a piece on
its homepage this week, “[We’re Optimizing Ourselves to Death](https://medium.com/s/buy-yourself/were-optimizing-ourselves-to-death-d41a3e7cc25a)”
by Zander Nethercutt.

Here’s what I love about Nethercutt’s piece.
When read alongside Neil postman’s
*[Amusing Ourselves to Death](https://www.amazon.com/Amusing-Ourselves-Death-Discourse-Business/dp/014303653X)*
(cartoon version by [Stuart McMillen here](https://twitter.com/stuart_mcmillen)), a new
theory takes shape that neither George Orwell nor Aldous Huxley predicted.
We don’t live in Orwell’s dystopia of banned books and thought crimes.
And we don’t live in Huxley’s hedonopia (it’s not a word, but maybe it *should* be) where
*everybody* is so addicted to Netflix and Fortnite that nobody bothers to work or
participate in society.

When we get home from work in Nethercutt’s world, the real world, we’re all so exhausted
it’s like we’re living with perpetually strained brains.
So we turn our brains off by watching Netflix, and in this way, our world rhymes with
Huxley’s. But where does the distinction between numbing ourselves with entertainment and
putting our feet up after a hard day’s work lie?

[Robert Greene](https://twitter.com/RobertGreene), one of my favorite writers, did a podcast,
“[Alive Time vs. Dead Time](https://fs.blog/robert-greene/)” in which he spoke plainly when
asked about his schedule.
He writes for three to four hours a day, then his brain is tired, and he enjoys “mindless
tv.” What I love about Greene here is that he doesn’t posture or
[virtue signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_signalling) about the necessity of
working ourselves to death.
He works a relatively short day—does Good Work—and rests.
While we’re all busy living in Nethercutt’s world, Greene’s found a different way to live.

I don’t know Greene, but I have a hunch that he’s proud of his work.
In Huxley’s world, I imagine we wouldn’t be so proud of our work—entertainment would be
less about rest and more about escape.
Which leads me to two questions to end this week’s newsletter.
First, are you proud of the work you do at the end of the day?
Second, is the time you spend after work—whether it’s family, friends, Fortnite, whatever
—worth the work?
If the answers to both are yes, then you live in a world not of Orwell, Huxley, or
Nethercutt.

The one thing the worlds of Orwell, Huxley, and Nethercutt have in common is that I don’t
want to live in those worlds.
I want to live in the fourth world.

Next week, we’ll talk about where to look within and share a few tools for figuring out
who you are and what you want.
Only when you’ve done that can you get down to business doing Good Work that’s either
worth hanging your brain up for or Good Work so good it turns your brain on when you get
home.

### This Week

#### BIG TECH

- [30m] Facebook employs thousands of people to moderate content posted on their platform to
  make sure videos of violence and all kinds of ugly stuff don’t hit your newsfeed.
  In “[The Trauma Floor: The secret lives of Facebook moderators in America](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona),”
  Casey Newton of *The Verge* reveals how brutally awful of a job being a content moderator
  for Facebook is.
  One moderator is quoted, “I don’t think it’s possible to do the job and not come out of it
  with some acute stress disorder or PTSD.”
- 🎮 Ever wonder what it’s like to work in an Amazon Warehouse?
  Wonder no more, as you can get as close to a first hand experience with the underbelly of
  Big Tech as you’re going to get through ”[The Amazon Race: A news game about what it’s like to work in an Amazon warehouse](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-02-27/amazon-warehouse-workers-game-race/10803346),”
  produced by ABC News Story Lab.

#### OFFICE CULTURE

- [22m] WeWork or WeWorship?
  ”[The Rise of the WeWorking Class](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/21/magazine/wework-coworking-office-space.html),”
  by [Gideon Lewis-Kraus](http://www.gideonlk.com/) of
  *[The New York Times Magazine](https://www.nytimes.com/section/magazine)*, is a #longread about
  the co-working space business that believes it’s on a mission to solve human loneliness
  and breakages in social cohesion.
- [2m] In ”[Slack Quiet Hours Experiment](https://medium.com/@nkammah/slack-quiet-hours-experiment-d7ab9405b703),”
  [Nassim Kammah](https://twitter.com/kepioo) of [MailChimp](https://twitter.com/mailchimp) shares
  his team’s experiment agreeing to stop slacking and start focusing.
- [9m] Remote work is hot right now.
  There’s plenty of bluster, but where’s the research?
  ”[Remote Teams](https://medium.com/@beccadownes/remote-teams-45038339ac68)” by Rebecca Downes
  is the best piece we have come across yet that asks great questions and rolls up research.
- \[10m] ”[Use It Too Much and Lose It? The Effect of Working Hours on Cognitive Ability](https://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/downloads/working-paper-series/wp2016n07.pdf),”
  by Shinya Kajitani, Colin McKenzie, and Kei Sakata of The Melbourne Institute, is an
  interesting study on working hours and cognition, concluding that cognition is best when
  work is limited to 25/weeks—at least in Australians over 40.

That’s Good Work for this week.
Looking forward to what’s next.
