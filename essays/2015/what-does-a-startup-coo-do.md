# What Does a Startup COO Actually Do?

> In this post I explore the ambiguity of the role of a COO (Chief Operating Officer) in a startup, and my journey to becoming one at Mattermark. Scroll to the bottom for further reading, as I have aggregated 10+ articles on the subject.

Titles shouldn’t matter, but unfortunately everyone has to have one — including me. Today, I am the COO at Mattermark. The only consensus on what a COO does is that there is no consensus, especially at startups (see articles at the bottom). The role varies from company to company, some don’t have the role, and the jury is out on whether startups need one.

I believe the job of a founding COO is to do the most important things the company hasn’t hired for yet, hire or delegate to someone in your place, and move on.
