# Identity

In September of 2018, a friend of mine invited me to a party for Fleet Week in San Francisco. The theme was "by land or by sea." Or something like that. Last minute, I found a purple pirate hat complete with octopus tentacles coming out of both sides—twirling around and all. Usually deployed in advance of all others, the question, "what do you do?" was replaced by, "what are you supposed to be?" It felt appropriate for a costume party. After trying on a few different labels, I settled on, "I am an Octopus Hunter." 

A few hours and double as many pints later, my friend asked me, "What is your identity?" She wasn't asking me how I identify in the 2018 sense of the phrase. Turns out, this is one of her favorite questions. I struggled and eventually turned it back on her. Of course she'd asked and been asked this many times, and she responded with a trail of different nouns—each complete with thoughtful elaborations. I so loved the question after a week or so of thinking of it as I walked that I sat down and took a first pass at my answer with a clear head. 

While I don't expect this will ever cover the full range of identities I take on or like to think I hold, I think this will be a fun list to keep, share, and update. For the sake of mystery and convenience, the list is not in any particular order of importance—so don't read into it.

  * "You develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics look so petty. You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter of a million miles out and say, 'Look at that, you son of a bitch." — Edgar Mitchell, Apollo 14 Astronaut

* I am a **writer**.
  * I have been happiest during the periods of my life in which I've written frequently. For all of my emotional hose kinks, writing may be the only way to relieve the pressure.
