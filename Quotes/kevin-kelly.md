> "A single thread of self-generation ties the cosmos, the bios, and the techies together into one creation. Humans are not the culmination of this trajectory but an intermediary, smack in the middle between the born and the made…the arc of complexity and the open-ended creation int he last four billion years is nothing compared to what lies ahead."

> Neal Stephenson [laments](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=TE0n_5qPmRM): “I saw the best minds of my generation… writing spam filters” he should not give up. It’s not that different that the best minds of a former generation designing oil filters. These are the unglamorous but essential tasks in constructing a whole new infrastructure.
