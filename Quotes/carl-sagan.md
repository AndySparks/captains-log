> "We are the custodians of life's meaning."

> “If we crave cosmic purpose, then let us find ourselves a worthy goal.”

> “Each victory is only a prelude to another."

> “If it can be destroyed by the truth, it deserves to be destroyed by the truth.”

> “For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love.” (from Samiur & Tess’s wooden block)

> "Knowledge is preferable to ignorance. Better, by far to embrace the hard truth, than a reassuring fable.Modern science has been a voyage into the unknown, with a lesson in humility waiting at every stop. Our common sense intuitions can be mistaken. Our preferences don't count. We do not live in a privileged reference frame.If we crave some cosmic purpose, then let us find ourselves a worthy goal.”

> "If it take a little myth and ritual to get us through a night that seems endless, who among us cannot sympathize and understand?”

> "We're Johnny-come-latelies; we live in the cosmic boondocks; we emerged from microbes in muck; apes are our cousins; our thoughts and feelings are not fully under our own control; and, on top of all this, we're making a mess of our planet, and becoming a danger to ourselves.”

> “If we ever reach the point where we think we thoroughly understand who we are and where we came from, we will have failed.” ([source](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/12/20/carl-sagan-varieties-of-scientific-experience/))
