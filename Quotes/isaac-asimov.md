# Isaac Asimov

> "Anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding it's way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge."

> "Out of danger and restless insecurity comes the force that pushes mankind to newer and loftier conquests." (The End of Eternity, pg. 246)
