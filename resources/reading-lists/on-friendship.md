## Quotes

> “You are only going to be as good as the people you surround yourself with. So if you find yourself surrounded by people who make you doubt yourself and make you question your self esteem and they don't support you or make you feel loved or appreciated, then it's better to be alone.“
  —Jason Statham (he shared on Facebook at some point that this was the best advice Cristiano Ronaldo ever gave him) 
  
> “Friendship is the greatest of worldly goods. Certainly to me it is the chief happiness of life. If I had to give a piece of advice to a young man about a place to live, I think I should say, 'Sacrifice almost anything to live where you can be near your friends.' I know I am very fortunate in that respect.” —C.S. Lewis (29 December 1935, p. 477)
