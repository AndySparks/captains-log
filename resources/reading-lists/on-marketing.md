    - Four tools for pricing:
        - **Map** out your product's substitutes (without your product, how would your target users solve this problem?) and compliments (what are the other products you'd expect to find in nature alongside your product?) — they anchor your buyer's thinking in S1.
        - **Design** with the buyers intuitive (S1) and rational (S2) thinking in mind.
        - **Prototype** a value-based price for your product (value > price).
        - **Build** an assortment around to probe demand curve and increase conversion.
