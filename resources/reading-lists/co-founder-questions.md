# Questions for Co-Founders Considering Working Together

When Josh Levy and I started Holloway, we used the following list of questions to determine whether we should work together. I believe the list of questions came from a blog post, but I don't know where. In an effort to find the post, I googled several questions and found partial text matches in both of the posts linked to in #further-reading.

## Time and Financial Commitments
1. When are we going full-time?
2. Are we allowed to take on anything outside of the company? Other (active or inactive) founder roles, advisory roles, paid work?
3. Are we going (or have we gone) unpaid and when would this change?
4. When will we take salaries? When will they be market-competetive?
5. Are we (or have we) put cash in to start the company?
6. What is the minimum duration we’re committing to work on the company?
## Working Styles and Culture
1. If you had to come up with 3-4 words to describe the culture you want to create, what would they be?
2. What values do we want to instill in our employees?
3. Who do we think the first 5 hires will be?
## Roles and Responsibilities
1. Strengths and weaknesses
    1. What are the areas we each know we’re not particularly good at?
    2. What would others who have worked with us say about us?
2. Ownership — for the first 12-18 months, for which areas are each of us
    1. not attached (not my strength, or interested but happy to have someone else do it)
    2. engaged (want to be consulted on key decisions, final say could/should be another person's)
    3. want control (need to be point person or have this explicitly joint/shared — not willing to compromise on some aspects)
3. How will decisions get made?
    1. Can one of us outvote the other?
    2. Can either of us fire the other?
    3. If one of us gets fired, what do we leave with?
4. If roles are hired, whom will they report to?
    1. Developers, designers, etc.? (See hires above.)
5. Legal questions
    1. Have you ever been fired, gone to jail, or done anything that would materially impact your time with the company?
    2. Do you advise, sit on any boards of companies, or do you have any conflict of interest with our project?
    3. Is there a “no compete” clause that is active at this time?
    4. For any cash we invest in the company, how is this treated? (e.g. debt? convertible debt? Does it buy a different class of shares?)
