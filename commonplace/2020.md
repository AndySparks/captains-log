# 2020

## Big Events
- COVID-19 hit in March. 
- Drove across the country with Kate in April.
- Moved in with Kate in May.

## Thinking Themes
- **Informational topographic awareness**: It’s about knowing what you know, knowing the landscape of knowledge. It’s about knowing what’s in the neighborhood. What’s nearby, what’s distant. It’s about making choices as to which directions you’ll set a course to learn more about, knowing that you’re actively choosing to leave others behind. It's about knowing who the major and upcoming players. And it's about knowing your history. Where did this thing come from? What's worked before? What's failed?
- **Payless, Nike, and Red Wing**: Consumerism is a plank each of us chooses to march ourselves right off of. I'm finding it helpful to view consumer options through the lens of Payless, Nike, and Red Wing. The first is low Quality because they physically fall apart. The second is low Quality because they fall out of fashion. The third, however, is high Quality because they are built to last for a decade. What if we look for more Red Wings, in our relationships, the company we keep, the people who we work for, the places we choose to shop?
- **FarOffMe vs. SoonSlashNowMe**: I come across a lot of people who think they're independent, but they're really not. These people unknowingly have a battle for supremacy raging between two versions of themselves: FarOffMe and SoonSlashNowMe. The second almost always is in a de facto vertical relationship, as the junior, to the first. We often give our FarOffMes broad power to make decisions for our SoonSlashNowMes. We tell ourselves we'll be happy when we write that book, have a new manager, start a family, so we start to sacrifice any sense of identity in the moment, all in pursuit of some fictional future.

- 2020/01/28: Got our first print copy of one of our books, *The Holloway Guide to Technical Recruiting and Hiring.*

## Habits
- Went back to riding my bike to work every day it doesn't rain. Began saving a ton of money. 
- Auditing spending on a weekly basis. One atomic habit instead of some kind of big monthly or quarterly review.
- Lightweight meal-prepping so I can come home from work and eat a cost effective and healthy meal after ~1 hour. 
- Minimizing after-work social commitments so I can focus on being healthy, reading / studying, and getting to bed at a reasonable hour. 
- Minimizing all weekday drinking. 
- Fell out of exercise habits when COVID hit. 
- In late summer, began reading and transferring all journal entries from Evernote to Roam in the morning.
