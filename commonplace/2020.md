## Thinking Themes
- Informational topographic awareness: It’s about knowing what you know, knowing the landscape of knowledge. It’s about knowing what’s in the neighborhood. What’s nearby, what’s distant. It’s about making choices as to which directions you’ll set a course to learn more about, knowing that you’re actively choosing to leave others behind. It's about knowing who the major and upcoming players. And it's about knowing your history. Where did this thing come from? What's worked before? What's failed?
