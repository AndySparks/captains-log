_Don't know what a commonplace is? Read [here](https://github.com/AndySparks/captains-log/blob/master/commonplace/wtf-is-a-commonplace.md)._

## Big Events

- Wildfires blanketed San Francisco with smoke for much of the summer and fall.

- Launched career as coach in September.
- Joe Biden elected president. 
- Traveled with Kate, Danielle & Kevin in October, November, & December.

## Thinking Themes
- **Informational Topographic Awareness**: It’s about knowing what you know, knowing the landscape of knowledge. It’s about knowing what’s in the neighborhood. What’s nearby, what’s distant. It’s about making choices as to which directions you’ll set a course to learn more about, knowing that you’re actively choosing to leave others behind. It's about knowing who the major and upcoming players. And it's about knowing your history. Where did this thing come from? What's worked before? What's failed?
- **Payless, Nike, and Red Wing**: Consumerism is a plank each of us chooses to march ourselves right off of. I'm finding it helpful to view consumer options through the lens of Payless, Nike, and Red Wing. The first is low Quality because they physically fall apart. The second is low Quality because they fall out of fashion. The third, however, is high Quality because they are built to last for a decade. What if we look for more Red Wings, in our relationships, the company we keep, the people who we work for, the places we choose to shop?
- **Balancing Short and Long Term Perspectives**: I come across a lot of people who think they're independent, but they're really not. These people unknowingly have a battle for supremacy raging between two versions of themselves: FarOffMe and SoonSlashNowMe. The second almost always is in a de facto vertical relationship, as the junior, to the first. We often give our FarOffMes broad power to make decisions for our SoonSlashNowMes. We tell ourselves we'll be happy when we write that book, have a new manager, start a family, so we start to sacrifice any sense of identity in the moment, all in pursuit of some fictional future.
- **Emotional Acuity**: Lisa Feldman Barrett calls this "emotional granularity," but the idea is that each of us stands to benefit from developing a greater emotional vocabulary and then learning how different emotions manifest in different people, including ourselves.
