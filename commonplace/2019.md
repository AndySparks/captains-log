### Product Design
- Learned a lot more about product design, specifically for web and mobile
- Began using "power tools" for Sketch like Runner, Abstract, and more.
- [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/book) was a huge help.

- Wrote 20+ editions of [Good Work](holloway.com/good-work).
- Learned a process of bulleting out "threads," a sort of ugly and unorganized outline, as a first step in writing. 
- Fell in love with the [madman, architect, carpenter, judge](http://www.ut-ie.com/b/b_flowers.html) idea of competing roles inside a writers' head.

### Leadership and management
- This is the first year I feel like I have a coherent management philosophy coming together. 
- Became self-aware of my tendency to throw people in the deep, which can lead to folks drowning.
- Re-learned, from Jerry Collona, that people are typically looking for love, belonging, or safety when they ask for something.
- Reflecting on the role attachment styles play in work and leadership. 
- Created a "Leadership" document in Notion that I use to manage myself. Thus far it's been a fascinating exercise.
