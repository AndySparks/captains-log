## Thinking Themes
- When to apply the extremes of thought: analysis vs. action
- Coordination vs. collaboration
- 5 years to do meaningful work in a field; 10 years to build a career in a field.
- Things that sound like a clichÃ© but are central to knowing ([Cowen](https://www.amazon.com/Stubborn-Attachments-Prosperous-Responsible-Individuals/dp/1732265135), 27)
- Ideas vs. directions
- Diversity in individuals' preference for what/how vs. why
- Avoiding self-referencing at work
- Differing management styles WRT independence
- Unprocessed emotion
